        <h3><b>Character Overview - Gregory House</b></h3>
        <p>The show follows the main character House. Certified as a diagnostician specializing in Infectious diseases
            and nephrology. His egotistical, narcissistic, and misanthropic personality brought viewers to the edge of
            their seat, always wondering what he would do next to cure his patient. He led the show with a sense of
            humor and sarcasm many loved.
            <br>
            <br>
            He was Born in 1959, to homemaker Blythe and marine pilot John House his father being in active duty causing
            House to live in various places throughout his childhood. Surviving a rough childhood with both mental and
            physical abuse, as well as forms of emotional neglect. The result leads to him struggling with relationships
            and isolating himself from the many chances of romantic and platonic connections House grew up as a smart
            child, spending free time diving into various interests, such as chemistry, piano and many more. This led
            him to pursue medicine, attending Maryland University and John Hopkins for, achieving high scores and high
            praise from professors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Prior to the show's beginning House has a medical issue himself his leg muscle had died and had to be
            surgically removed, leading to him requiring a cane to get around, and continues throughout the show with
            severe pain problems. Further his injury catalyst a Vicodin addiction, supposed to be a tool for his chronic
            pain. Several times throughout the show House goes through withdrawal, some overdose scares, and other
            medical problems from the result of this addiction and disability.
            <br>
            <br>
            House rarely follows medical intuition rules and federal laws, many times throughout the show House makes
            choices for the stake of the life of his patient, usually being illegal in some form. He coerces his team of
            three young doctors to complete unneeded tests, break into people's homes and go against the patients'
            desires to continue the path he believes is best, often accusing them of being stupid or suicidal to get
            them to agree to his whims. Though he is generally right about what is wrong with his patients, falters once
            or twice wanting to solve the mystery as fast as possible more than saving the patient's life in their best
            interests, in the end he still solves the case proving he is the best person for the job no matter his
            choices.
            <br>
            <br>
            House continues to be loved throughout all seasons, his charming and reckless personality only making the
            show better, and his personal arch takes many forms. His struggles throughout the show how growth as a
            character is hard for him, taking leaps and bounds, nonetheless returning to his personality with a few
            small lessons gained along the way but never completely changing or growing. Always returning to his
            personal mantras of “people are idiots,” “always lie” and “don't change”, himself included.
